Coming Soon: A large update to this mod!

Some chat commands written by MLK94 & BOLT, written between 2023 and 2025. Also credit to Dreamer & Buzzington from Gadmeer for writing the SNOOP chat command. 

Updating this archive soon, there will be 10 or so chat commands ranging from useful admin monitor tools to map related search tools. 

Most of the chat commands are experimental and have not been extensively tested on a public server.

Most of the upcoming mod was written in the older Minetest code and needs some updating to core.

Most of the code is very messy, I am not a natural programmer and I have learned LUA from reading the luablocks of other admins on Dominion.
